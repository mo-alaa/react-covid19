# react-covid19

 A simple application the shows the daily data of covid-19 cases, using react.
 
 This app is inspired from the app made by [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls)
 
However there are some issues about the graph, as it gets the cumulative data. This is actually an issue in the api that i use, because it can't get the specific data for each day.
