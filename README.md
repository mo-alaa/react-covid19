# react-covid19

 A simple application the shows the daily data of covid-19 cases, using react.
 
This app is inspired from the app made by [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls)

But I've changedthe UI alot as well as the api.

However, there are some issues about the graph, as it gets the cumulative data. This is actually an issue in the api that i use, because it can't get the specific data for each day.
