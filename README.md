# react-covid19

 A simple application the shows the daily data of covid-19 cases, using react.
 
The app is deployed to Render:
 
https://react-covid19.onrender.com/
 
The graph is inspired from [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls)

However, there are some issues about the graph, as it gets the cumulative data. This is actually an issue in the api that i use, because it can't get the specific data for each day.
